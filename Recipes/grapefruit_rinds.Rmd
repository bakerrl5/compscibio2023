# Grapefruit Rinds
(or lemon, orange, or a combination)

## Ingredients

* 4 cups of feeled citrus rind
* 2 cups of sugar

## Instructions

Remove most of the pith from the rinds. Cut into small (thin but long) slices. Cover the rinds with cold water and bring it to a boil. Drain the water. Repeate three times (this removes the bitterness). Set aside.

Mix the sugar with 1 cup of water and gently boil until the sugar is dissolved. Add the peels and gently boil until the syrup is thick and almost all absorbed by the peel.

Drain the peels, roll in sugar dry dugar, then let them dry overnight on cookie sheets.
