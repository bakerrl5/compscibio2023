# Nut Rolls

## Ingredients

* 0.5 lb butter
* 2 cups flour
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 0.75 cups white sugar
* 1 cup walnots
* powdered sugar (for toppings)

## Instructions

**Dough:** Cut the butter into the flour. Add the egg yolk and sour cream. Lightly knead and form a ball. Wrap in saran wrap and refrigerate overnight (or freeze). 

**Filling:** In a food processor combine cinammon, white sugar, and walnuts.

Divide the dough ball into fourths. Roll it into a circle and cut the circle into eights (like a pie). Sprinkle the filling on each piece, then roll from the outside of the circle inward so the point is on the outside. Bake at 350&deg;F until lightly browned. Cool, then sprinkle powdered sugar through a hand strainer over the nut rolls.
