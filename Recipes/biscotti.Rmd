# Angie's Cookies (Biscotti)

## Ingredients

* 6 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* 0.5 lb margarine
* 3.75 cups flour
* 2.5 Tbl baking powder
* 2 Tbl anise or almond flavoring
* 1 cup nuts (almond, walnuts, etc)

## Instructions

Beat eggs, sugar, butter, and flavoring together. Add just enough flour to keep the batter from sticking. Turn out onto the counter and shape into 4-6 small loaves. Bake at 375&deg;F until an inserted toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes. Slice, place back onto cookie sheets and toast at 450&degF until lightly browned. Turn once. Watch carefully - it only takes a minute.

This recipe can be made many ways: add a cup of dried cranberries or cherries, and/or add 0.25 cups unsweetened chocolate powder, vary nuts and flovoring oils. Any combintation of the above.
